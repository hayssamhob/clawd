# Cascade MCP Integration

When receiving tasks via MCP delegation from OpenClaw:

1. Complete the task as requested
2. Write results to `OPENCLAW_RESULT.md` in the workspace root using this format:

```markdown
# Task: [brief task description]

## Status: COMPLETE | PARTIAL | FAILED

## Summary
[Brief summary of what was accomplished]

## Files Changed
- path/to/file1.ext - [what changed]
- path/to/file2.ext - [what changed]

## Output
[Any relevant output, logs, test results, or error messages]

## Next Steps
[What should happen next, if anything. Leave empty if task is fully complete]
```

3. Be concise but complete
4. Always update OPENCLAW_RESULT.md even if the task fails - include error details
5. Focus on the task - don't ask for clarification unless absolutely necessary
