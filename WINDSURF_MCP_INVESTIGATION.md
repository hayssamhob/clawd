# Windsurf MCP Investigation

## Goal
Determine if Windsurf supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for bidirectional communication with OpenClaw.

## Questions to Answer
1. Does Windsurf expose an MCP server?
2. Can we build an MCP wrapper around Windsurf's API?
3. What internal APIs does Windsurf expose?
4. Can extensions access Cascade programmatically?

## Steps
1. Check Windsurf documentation for MCP mentions
2. Inspect Windsurf's extension API
3. Look for existing Windsurf MCP integrations
4. Test MCP client connection attempts
5. Review Windsurf's source code (if available)
