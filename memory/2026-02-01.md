# 2026-02-01 - Augustus Upgrades

## 🚀 Major Upgrades Completed

Following the YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/UTCi_q6iuCM), implemented 5 key upgrades to OpenClaw:

### ✅ 1. Enhanced Memory
- **Enabled memory flush:** Records important context before memory compactions
- **Enabled session memory search:** Can search through entire conversation history
- **Config:** `agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.enabled = true`
- **Config:** `agents.defaults.memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory = true`

### ✅ 2. Brain + Muscles Architecture (Documented)
- **Brain:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (thinking, planning, communication)
- **Muscles:** Specialized models for specific tasks
  - Coding: Codex CLI / DeepSeek / Qwen
  - Web Search: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Brave API)
  - Social: Grok (for X/Twitter)
  - Vision: Built into Claude
  - Reasoning: QwQ (local Ollama)
- **Documented in:** `TOOLS.md`

### ✅ 3. Brain Dump + Expectations Set
- **Enhanced USER.md:** Added goals, work style, daily rhythm, preferences
- **Enhanced SOUL.md:** Added proactive work expectations, reverse prompting guidance
- **Key mindset:** Treat Augustus like an employee, not a search engine
- **Expectation:** Work proactively while Hayssam sleeps, surprise him with improvements

### 🔄 4. Reverse Prompting (Implementing Now)
Instead of waiting for instructions, ask Hayssam:
- "What tasks should I prioritize based on your goals?"
- "What information do you need from me?"
- "What pain points should I solve?"

### 📋 5. Custom Tooling (To Build)
**Next step:** Build custom tools for our workflow:
- Task/project tracker
- Memory viewer/organizer
- Mission control dashboard
- Document browser for past work

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Memory is everything:** Files > mental notes. Document everything.
2. **Specialized models save money:** Don't use Opus for everything when Gemini/Qwen can handle it.
3. **Set expectations explicitly:** SOUL.md and USER.md guide my behavior.
4. **Be proactive, not reactive:** Ask what needs doing, suggest better approaches.

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Ask Hayssam:** What should I prioritize? What pain points exist? ✅ ANSWERED
2. **Build custom tooling:** Start with a simple task tracker or mission control ✅ IN PROGRESS
3. **Nightly builds:** Pick something to build while Hayssam sleeps ✅ DOING NOW
4. **Learn preferences:** Track Hayssam's work patterns, preferences, pain points over time

## 🧠 Context

- **Hayssam's vision:** Change the world through technology + human-powered intelligence
- **My role:** Creative partner, proactive builder, not just a tool
- **Work style:** Precise, clear, reliable, with creative energy
- **Timezone:** Asia/Makassar (WITA, UTC+8)
