## 🎯 Workflow Demonstration

### Example 1: Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/windsurf-autonomous-model-selection

# Develop and commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(windsurf): Add autonomous model selection system

Implements intelligent model selection based on task complexity..."

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/windsurf-autonomous-model-selection --no-ff

# Result: Clean merge preserving branch history
```

### Example 2: Documentation Update
```bash
# Direct commit to main (simple change)
git add GIT_WORKFLOW.md
git commit -m "docs: Add comprehensive Git workflow guide

Added GIT_WORKFLOW.md with best practices for branching,
commit messages, and daily development routines."
```

### Example 3: Maintenance
```bash
# Cleanup commit
git rm --cached *.log
git commit -m "chore: Remove log files from version control

Removed log files from Git tracking (kept locally).
Now ignored via .gitignore as they clutter commit history."
```
