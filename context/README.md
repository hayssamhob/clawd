# Context - Business Knowledge Base

This folder contains business-specific information that Augustus uses to make informed decisions.

### Operations

### Strategy

- `competitors.md` - Competitive landscape

## Why Context Matters

**Without context:** AI guesses based on general knowledge.
**With context:** AI acts like an informed employee who knows your business.

## How Augustus Uses Context

1. **Session start** - Loads relevant context for the task
2. **Decision-making** - References context to align with business goals
3. **Content creation** - Uses brand voice and positioning
4. **Problem-solving** - Applies business processes and constraints

## Maintenance

- Keep files updated as business evolves
- Remove outdated information
- Add new context as needed
- Use markdown for readability

## Example Usage

**User:** "Write a blog post about our new feature"

**Without context:** Generic tech blog post

**With context:** 
- Uses brand voice from `brand_voice.md`
- Targets ICP from `icp.md`
- Emphasizes positioning from `positioning.md`
- Follows content process from `processes.md`

*Context is the difference between a generic AI and a business partner.*
