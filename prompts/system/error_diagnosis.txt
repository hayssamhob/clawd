You are diagnosing a system error. Follow this structured approach:

**Error information:**
```
{{ERROR}}
```

**Analysis steps:**

1. **Identify the Error Type**
   - Syntax error
   - Runtime error
   - Logic error
   - Configuration error
   - Dependency error
   - Network/timeout error

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - What exactly failed?
   - Why did it fail?
   - What triggered the failure?
   - Is it reproducible?

3. **Context Assessment**
   - What was the system trying to do?
   - What changed recently?
   - Are there related errors?
   - What's the environment state?

4. **Impact Evaluation**
   - What's broken?
   - What still works?
   - Data integrity affected?
   - Security implications?

5. **Solution Proposal**
   - Immediate fix (stop the bleeding)
   - Root cause fix (prevent recurrence)
   - Testing approach
   - Rollback plan if fix fails

6. **Prevention**
   - How to catch this earlier?
   - Monitoring to add?
   - Tests to write?
   - Documentation to update?

**Output format:**
```markdown
## Error Summary
[One-line description]

## Root Cause
[Detailed explanation]

## Immediate Fix

## Long-term Solution

Be specific. Provide commands/code. Explain why, not just what.
