You are conducting a comprehensive code review. Analyze the following code for:

**Security:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Credential exposure
- Input validation gaps

**Performance:**
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) or worse)
- Unnecessary database queries (N+1 problem)
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations
- Unoptimized loops

**Best Practices:**
- Code duplication (DRY violations)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Error handling completeness
- Naming conventions
- Code readability

**Bugs:**
- Edge cases not handled
- Null/undefined reference errors
- Off-by-one errors
- Race conditions
- Type coercion issues

**Code to review:**
```
{{CODE}}
```

**Output format:**
For each issue found:
1. **Category:** [Security/Performance/Best Practice/Bug]
2. **Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
3. **Line:** [Line number or range]
4. **Issue:** [What's wrong]
5. **Fix:** [Specific solution]

If code is clean, say "✅ No issues found" and highlight what was done well.

Be specific. Reference line numbers. Provide code snippets for fixes.
